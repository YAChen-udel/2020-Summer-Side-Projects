# 2020-Summer-Side-Projects
Working on projects is the best way to spend my Summer of 2020 being a computer science student. 
Projects are the best way to enhance my skills in any programming language. Best way to get familiar with this language is through working on some real-time projects.

I find many good side-projects on [Mega Project List] (https://github.com/karan/Projects) from @goel.io
